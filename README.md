# test-survivor

npm install

npm run dev

go to localhost:3000

The App is responsive.

The database is mongoDB Atlas, you can update the status (infected) and the change is going to be added in the UI and the database. 

The app is using Nextjs API (POST/GET/PUT methods) and staticProps for the dashboard table.

You can Add survivors with the add link and the data will be uploaded to the database (mongoDB Atlas), if you have any issue with this let me know because maybe I need to whitelist your IP.

If more info is needed, don't hesitate to ask me.
