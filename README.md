# test-survivor

npm install

npm run dev

go to localhost:3000

The App is responsive.

I'm using Redux because with more time this can be scalated with Saga and use a real database.

Or use another libraries like SWR to manage the state and a cloud database.

The app is using Nextjs API (POST/GET methods) and staticProps for the dashboard.

You can Add survivors with the add link and the data will be uploaded to the database (mongoDB Atlas), if you have any issue with this let me know because maybe I need to whitelist your IP.

If more info is needed, don't hesitate to ask me.
