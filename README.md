The app is using a fake db with a json file.

I'm using Redux because with more time this can be scalated with Saga and use a real database.
Or use another libraries like SWR to manage the state and a cloud database.

The app is using Nextjs API and staticProps for the dashboard, if needed I could go and create an express API but I think that Nextjs did an awesome work with their API routes.

Due to the nature of Next.js is not possible to update the json file without facing issues, if a crud system is needed I would need more time to create a cloud database.

Even if a login/register system is needed I can go with Firebase directly.

If more info is needed, don't hesitate to ask me.
