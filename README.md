The app is using a fake db with a json file.

I'm using Redux because with more time this can be scalated with Saga and use a real database.
Or use another libraries like SWR to manage the state and a cloud database.

Due to the nature of Next.js is not possible to update the json file, if a crud system is needed I would need more time to create a cloud database.

If more info is needed, don't hesitate to ask me.
